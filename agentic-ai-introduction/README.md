## Outputs and AI context

This folder contains two lecture drafts generated from the same base idea/input:
- `lecture_by_chatgpt.md`: narrative, lecture-style version (reader-friendly). Generated by ChatGPT (GPT5.2).
- `lecture_by_codex.md`: compact outline version. Generated by Codex.

The `.aiassistant/` folder contains **context/instructions for the IDE’s LLM tooling** (prompt scaffolding, formatting rules, etc.).  
It is **not lecture content**, but helps make generated drafts more consistent and reproducible.
