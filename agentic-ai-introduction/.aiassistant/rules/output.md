Create a Markdown file for the lecture output and use sections
to differentiate between topics you cover.
Use emojis wherever it supports highlighting of important concepts, take home messages
of differences. Only use emojis that are semantically linked to what they highlight. 
The lecture shall not take longer than 10 minutes.
Include further topics, keywords as references after every section so people can follow up
topics later if they want to deep dive into them.
