Assume shadow IT: the laptops of employers in the audience manage installations and updates
on their own. The local IT department only does important security announcements for operations systems
and random unannounced checks of the OS updates.

Topics to cover are:

- What are autonomous agentic AI systems? 
- How do autonomous agentic AI systems differ from LLMs with chat-prompts, RPAs and RAGs. Give an easy-to-understand overview about the concepts and a simple-to-follow daily office example
- What are common attacks against autonomous AI systems?
- How can a user protect the environment from these attacks?
- What can developers do, to harden their autonomous AI system? How does sandboxing work here?

Give an overview of how exfiltration attacks work with the example of OpenClaw and when it is connected
to a publicly available communication platform. Assume Whatsapp and assume the victim is also in a public Whatsapp channel, where the attack starts. For the attack, assume network access is possible for the agent
so HTTP messages can leave the local network and can send to any service in the internet.
