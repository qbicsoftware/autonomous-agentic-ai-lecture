The scope of this project is a lecture with an investigation into what
autonomous agentic AI actually is, how it is distinguished from classical
LLM services like chatbots like ChatGPT.

The primary focus shall lie on security concerns when using agentic AI tools in 
research organizations like universities. 

Beginning of 2026, OpenClaw gain public interest due to its ease of use and rich integration
plugins to existing messenger APIs like Discord, Whatsapp, Slack, Microsoft Teams and others.
