# Agentic AI introduction

A small, in-house sensitization project about **agentic (autonomous) AI**: what it is, how it differs from “classic” LLM chatbots, and why it matters—especially from a **security and organizational risk** perspective in research environments.


Add a short disclaimer section near the top (right after the title / before “What’s inside”) and optionally repeat a one-liner again at the end.
You can paste this as-is (German wording, matching your terms):

> **Disclaimer (WIP)**  
> This document/project is **work in progress (WIP)** and the information provided is **not complete** and may be incorrect or outdated.  
> It does **not** constitute **legal advice**.  
> It is **not a guidance** and **not a security best practice**.  
> It is intended as an **impulse for discussion** and internal awareness building.


## What’s inside
- A short lecture-style write-up introducing **autonomous agentic AI** concepts
- An investigation-oriented narrative focused on **security concerns** (e.g., prompt injection, data exfiltration, plugin/integration risks)
- Supporting notes/materials used to communicate these ideas in a compact format

## Focus & motivation
Agentic AI systems can **plan and act** via tools and integrations (messengers, APIs, files), which expands the attack surface compared to answer-only chatbots. This project aims to help readers recognize common risks and build practical awareness for safer adoption.

## Who this is for
- Researchers, staff in organizations (e.g., universities) evaluating or encountering agentic AI tools
- Anyone needing a quick, non-alarmist introduction to **agentic AI security implications**

## How to use
Read the lecture notes in this folder from top to bottom. The material is designed to be digestible in a short session and to spark internal discussion about safe usage and mitigations.
